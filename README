NAME
    XXX - See Your Data in the Nude

SYNOPSIS
        use XXX;
        XXX my $dog = Dog->new({has => ['fleas', 'style']});
        my $dog = XXX Dog->new({has => ['fleas', 'style']});
        my $dog = Dog->new(XXX {has => ['fleas', 'style']});
        my $dog = Dog->new({XXX has => ['fleas', 'style']});
        my $dog = Dog->new({has => XXX ['fleas', 'style']});
        my $dog = Dog->new({has => [XXX 'fleas', 'style']});

DESCRIPTION
    XXX.pm exports a function called XXX that you can put just about
    anywhere in your Perl code to make it die with a YAML dump of the
    arguments to its right.

    The charm of XXX-debugging is that it is easy to type and rarely
    requires parens and stands out visually so that you remember to remove
    it.

    XXX.pm also exports WWW, YYY and ZZZ which do similar debugging things.

    To use Data::Dumper instead of YAML:

        use XXX -dumper;

FUNCTIONS
    WWW WWW will warn a dump of its arguments, and then return the original
        arguments. This means you can stick it in the middle of expressions.

        mnemonic: W for warn

    XXX XXX will die with a dump of its arguments.

        mnemonic: XXX == Death, Nudity

    YYY YYY will print a dump of its arguments, and then return the original
        arguments. This means you can stick it in the middle of expressions.

        mnemonic: YYY == Why Why Why or YAML YAML YAML

    ZZZ ZZZ will Carp::confess a dump of its arguments.

        mnemonic: You should confess all your sins before you sleep.
        zzzzzzzz
